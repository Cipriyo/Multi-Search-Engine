BEFORE THE LICENCE I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY:
  I WORKED 3 MONTH ON THIS BECAUSE I AM A LITTLE DEV, SO PLEASE USE MY WEBSITE : https://cipriyo.github.io/Multi-Search-Engine/ ;
  AND DON'T COPY MY CODE TO USE IT :'(
  
LAST THING : ON THE LICENCE IS SAY EVERYBODY CAN USE MY CODE IF YOU GIVE ME CREDIT BUT ME I DON'T WANT THAT JUST DON'T USE MY CODE PLEASE
(and if you say why I don't edit the licence it's because if I edit it I am not protected)
